Following this blog, I  have now created my created an idea for my freedom project, and I have more than enough ideas for it, futures ideas are going to be added as well, I spent a good amount of time choosing my topic, which I have set on to be construction, I thought of some ideas for the future and got solid information about current things in construction and demolition. I will continue to research, I used website such as [Peterson Cat](https://www.petersoncat.com/products/demolition-equipment) and the [CAT](https://www.cat.com/en_US/by-industry/construction-industry-resources/technology.html) website, both containing the neccessary information for my topic.
