## Lookback
Taking a look back on what SEP did, it taught me many things, how to work with other people, how to manage time correctly, and even interact with people I didn't want to. It taught me how to handle stress, but also handle my work ethic, even if I didn't put it into affect. 

## At the end
At the end of SEP, I am regretfully still upset with it, as it has caused me much stress, so I wish to be rid of it, even though it taught me many good things, the mental struggle it put me through was intense, and I no longer want to interact with it.
