            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-4">What are some current technologies we have in the real world related to constuction you might ask? Well, first off, he have the simplest of the bunch, scaffolding. It may seem unambiguous, but scaffolding was neccessary in construction, even back in ancient civlizations. It was how the pyramids were built after all. Another current invention we have in construction is that of cranes. Used in most of if not all large scale construction today, it is vital for moving objects and materials up and down a construction site.</div>
            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-4">For current softwares used for construction, we have Procore and Viewpoint. These two softwares are both used for managing, scheduling, and financial managaing for construction, very simple, but very helpful.</div>
            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-4">But what about the future? what does the future hold that gives us the ability to strengthen our ability to do construction? Well, lets think for a moment, what could we as people do to in the future to make construction easier? Well, lets talk about it, and see what we can do.</div>
