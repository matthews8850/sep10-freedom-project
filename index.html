            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-4"><p class="mgn">Construction is a very diffucult process, there are many different elements, strategies, and techniques that go into construction. People have to be strong and coordinated. There has to be fair pay and good time for scheduling, and the tools used have to be well made and sturdy, if any of this is disturbed, the entire flow of construction could be interupted. So heres some important technlogies about construction.</p></div>
            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-4"><p class="mgn">What are some current technologies we have in the real world related to constuction you might ask? Well, first off, he have the simplest of the bunch, scaffolding. It may seem unambiguous, but scaffolding was neccessary in construction, even back in ancient civlizations. It was how the pyramids were built after all. Another current invention we have in construction is that of cranes. Used in most of if not all large scale construction today, it is vital for moving objects and materials up and down a construction site.</p></div>
            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-4"><p class="mgn">For current softwares used for construction, we have Procore and Viewpoint. These two softwares are both used for managing, scheduling, and financial managaing for construction, very simple, but very helpful.</p></div>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-3"><p class="mgn">But what about the future? what does the future hold that gives us the ability to strengthen our ability to do construction? Well, lets think for a moment, what could we as people do to in the future to make construction easier? Well, lets talk about it, and see what we can do.</p></div>
            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-3"><p class="mgn">In the future, there will be many different thing thats could be made to make buildings, one of these ideas of mine is a building printer, this invention can and will 3d print full scale buildings from the the bottom up to make construction easier, and create jobs, as it will require multiple people to fun and ensure it does not have a mechanical failure.</p></div>

What it will do is replace the use of cranes, it will bring heavy materials to places on the job site that are diffucult to reach, as it will be able to fly these materials up to the workers so they can put them into place to continue building the structure.</p></div>
